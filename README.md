# MCEE-2.0
Confounding factors are non-research factors which affect one or more of the variables being studied and may lead to inaccurate or biased results. It is well recognized that physiological and environmental factors such as race, diet, age, gender, blood pressure, diurnal cycles, and so on have a definite influence on mammalian metabolism. To eliminate the noisy effect of known confounders, a method with a GUI called metabolic confounding effect elimination (MCEE) was developed and was applied successfully in a wide range of metabolomics studies (https://github.com/chentianlu/MCEE-1.0). To keep up with the development of computational metabolomics and the growing number of user requests, an upgraded version of MCEE with more options and enhanced performance was designed and developed. Besides the generalized linear model (GLM) method, a multivariate method canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was introduced for affected metabolites selection, considering the complicated intra-correlations and co-linearity within metabolome. Multiple confounders are acceptable and can be identified and processed simultaneously or separately.
